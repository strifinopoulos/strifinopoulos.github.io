title: 'Searching for exotic scalars at fusion reactors'
summary: 'Part of the energy created in deuterium-tritium fusion reactors is carried away from plasma  by a high-intensity neutron flux, which is then absorbed by the inner walls of the reactor. The interactions of neutrons with the materials within the walls can result in the production of dark sector particles, feebly interacting light scalars or pseudoscalars, via nuclear transitions. We estimate the potential size of such dark sector flux and consider possible detection methods at current and future thermonuclear fusion reactors.'

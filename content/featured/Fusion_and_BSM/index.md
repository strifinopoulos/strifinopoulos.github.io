title: 'Searching for exotic scalars at fusion reactors'
summary: Part of the energy created in deuterium-tritium fusion reactors is carried away from plasma  by a high-intensity neutron flux, which is then absorbed by the reactor's inner walls. The neutron flux can be used to sustain the reaction by the following mechanism: the walls are coated with lithium-rich breeding blankets, in which a fraction of neutrons interacts with lithium, creating tritium, which can be, in turn, used a fuel for the main reaction. The interactions of neutrons with the materials within the breeding blanket can also result in the production of dark sector particles, feebly interacting light scalars or pseudoscalars, via nuclear transitions.

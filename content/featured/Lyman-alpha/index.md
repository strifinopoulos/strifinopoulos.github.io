title: 'Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest'
summary: 'We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-&alpha fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles.'

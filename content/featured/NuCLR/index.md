title: 'NuCLR: Nuclear Co-Learned Representations'
summary: We introduce Nuclear Co-Learned Representations (NuCLR), a deep learning model that predicts various nuclear observables, including binding and decay energies, and nuclear charge radii. The model is trained using a multi-task approach with shared representations and obtains state-of-the-art performance, achieving levels of precision that are crucial for understanding fundamental phenomena in nuclear (astro)physics.

title: 'The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses'
summary: 'We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for nuclear masses, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI predictions can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models. Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969.'

title: 'Implications for Pulsar Timing Arrays of Sub-solar Black Hole Detections: From LVK to Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer'
summary: 'The detection of compact binary mergers with sub-solar masses at gravitational-wave observatories could mark the groundbreaking discovery of primordial black holes. Concurrently, evidence for a nHz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays could suggest a non-astrophysical origin, potentially arising from scalar-induced gravitational waves. In this work, we analyze the connection between the two phenomena in the case where they share a common origin: the collapse of large primordial curvature perturbations in the early universe.'

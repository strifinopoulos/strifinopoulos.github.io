I am a theoretical physicist exploring the boundaries of the Standard Model of particle physics and the Lambda cold dark matter model of cosmology. My approach integrates a wide spectrum of methods, ranging from traditional model building in Quantum Field Theory to Quantum Information Theory and intepretable Artificial Intelligence.
